            <h1>Virtual Assistant FAQs</h1> <br>
        If you’ve never had a personal assistant or virtual assistant before, you probably have a lot of questions. Here are the most common questions people ask us when looking for virtual assistant services.<br><br>
        
            <h4>How many hours a week will I save?</h4>>
        With your own virtual assistant from Zirtual, you can save anywhere from 12 to 50 hours per week. You’ll save even more time than your assistant clocks-in because they are so experienced in administrative support and can typically handle them faster than you can.<br><br>
        
        <h4>What’s the first thing to outsource to my virtual assistant?</h4>>
        Our community (small businesses, executives, founders, middle management, busy parents and the list goes on) usually hand off their inbox and calendar management first because these are sneaky time killers. Once delegated to your virtual assistant, you get time back in your day immediately, and perpetually. But, you can start with whatever task or project is most pressing or distracting.<br><br>
        
        <h4>What tasks do Virtual Assistants perform?</h4>>
        Virtual assistants perform an incredibly wide variety of tasks. Common tasks are things like inbox management, social media management, scheduling of all sorts, bookkeeping and other recordkeeping, price comparisons, product research, and the list goes on – for a more comprehensive list of common tasks – click here and click around on all the “what we do” sections. But, a virtual assistant can also help with less obvious things like supporting a job search by looking for appropriate openings, submitting your resume, sending cover letters, and booking the interview. Let your imagination run wild – Zirtual virtual assistants are creative, flexible, and fast learners and can help anyone from a small business to large companies, and individuals to executives.<br><br>
        
        <h4>Why should I use Zirtual for my virtual assistance needs?</h4>>
        If you want to work with a smart, experienced, freelance virtual assistant who is trained and ready to help you, who lives in the US, and has a college degree, then you should choose Zirtual for your virtual assistance needs. Our account managers do an excellent job of pairing you up with just the right person for your specific virtual assistance needs. We also manage your virtual assistant’s workload so you enjoy consistent availability. With 2-hour response times, working with a Zirtual virtual assistant instead of a basic virtual assistant is key to getting the most from virtual assistance.<br><br>
        
        <h4>Is hiring a virtual assistant difficult?</h4>>
        That all depends on how you go about the hiring process. Just under half of our clients tried hiring a virtual assistant themselves before coming to Zirtual. Rather than deal with the hassle of writing a job description, posting it to social media, interviewing dozens of candidates, assessing their skills, their experiences, and trying to determine if they are the right assistant for the job, paying a virtual assistant salary and associated taxes, they found it easier to simply let Zirtual handle the process. Hiring a virtual assistant is something most people have never done before, but we’ve done thousands of times. Leave the business of finding the perfect administrative assistant to Zirtual. Remember, the whole point is staying focused on what makes you amazing. We’ve got the experience to hire a virtual assistant that’s perfect for you.<br><br>
        
        <h4>When is the right time to hire virtual assistants?</h4>>
        The short answer is; before you need one. The more common answer of when people actual hire a virtual assistant is when you realize you are spending your valuable time tasks that are necessary, but not critical and don’t take advantage of your specific skills! A virtual executive assistant can turn a hectic, always just a bit behind schedule life into a hyper-productive, highly focused success story in very little time.<br><br>
        
        <h4>Are Virtual Assistants only for work related administrative tasks?</h4>>
        No, your Virtual Assistant can help you with all sorts of personal tasks as well. From booking travel arrangements for the annual family vacation to ordering flowers for a special occasion, your virtual assistant is dedicated to making your life better, in and out of work. Life isn’t all business.<br><br>
        
        <h4>What if I’m too overwhelmed of don’t want to train a virtual assistant?</h4>>
        This is super common. Don’t worry, we can match you with a virtual assistant who is already trained in the skills you or your business need. Sure, you will have to show them the ropes, but the good news is that they’ve done similar work many times for other companies and they have tons of experience in making this easy for you.<br><br>
        
        <h4>I think I have unique virtual assistance needs, can I talk to someone about them?</h4>>
        Certainly. We’d love to talk to you. Many of Zirtual’s customers prefer to have a quick consultation before starting. Ask us any questions you have specific to your business or industry and talk to us about your virtual assistance needs so we can make sure that there will be a Zirtual Virtual Assistant who can expertly assist you. Click here to book a call with one of our Delegation Consultants.<br><br>
        
        <h4>Is there anything virtual assistants can’t do?</h4>>
        They are all powerful superheroes capable of saving the day – but yes, there are a few jobs your virtual assistant isn’t going to be able to help you with. Answering phone calls, cold calling for lead generation, advanced accounting, and obviously anything that requires them to be physically present like accepting an Oscar on your behalf (okay, they’d probably be willing to do that) are outside the services Zirtual provides to the companies it serves. Your virtual assistant can make calls on your behalf to do things like book travel, or buy things, but they are not a receptionist or a smile and dial machine.<br><br>
